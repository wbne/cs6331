multimedia semester project
qr code reading and overlaying the media in real-time
one of the more fun things is that websites and browsers will not allow:
- mixed requests (http + https)
- internal embedding of websites
- consistent sizing (apple)

some polishing in the UI is required but goals from a technical perspective are:
- playing around with cocossd and transfer learning
- working with markers instead of qr codes (arjs?)
- utilizing tfjs since cocossd provides consistent 20fps
- experimenting with loading in images instead of websites
